TITLE: Mechanisms Linking Obesity to Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes

ABSTRACT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND: 
The strong association between obesity and Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM) has led to 
the coinage of the term "Diabesity." However, not all obese individuals 
develop diabetes, and the molecular mechanisms linking excess adipose tissue 
to systemic insulin resistance remain an area of intense study. This review 
focuses on the "adipose tissue expandability" hypothesis and the role of 
inflammation.

MECHANISMS REVIEWED: 
1. **Lipotoxicity:** When subcutaneous adipose tissue reaches its storage 
capacity, excess lipids spill over into non-adipose tissues (liver, muscle, 
pancreas) as Ectopic Fat. This leads to the accumulation of toxic lipid 
metabolites (ceramides, diacylglycerol) that interfere with insulin signaling 
pathways.
2. **Adipokines:** Adipose tissue functions as an endocrine organ. In obesity, 
it shifts from secreting insulin-sensitizing hormones (Adiponectin) to 
pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6, Resistin).
3. **Macrophage Infiltration:** Hypertrophic adipocytes attract immune cells 
(macrophages), leading to a chronic state of low-grade inflammation that 
perpetuates systemic insulin resistance.

CONCLUSION: 
Visceral adiposity acts as a pathogenic depot that drives metabolic dysfunction 
through lipotoxicity and inflammation. Therapeutic strategies that specifically 
target visceral fat reduction or improve adipose tissue function may offer 
novel avenues for preventing the progression from obesity to T2DM.

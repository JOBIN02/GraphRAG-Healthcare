1. THE "DAILY INSPECTION" PROTOCOL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since nerves may be damaged, pain is not a reliable warning sign. You must use your eyes.
* **Check:** Bottoms of feet (use a mirror), between toes, and heels.
* **Look for:** Cuts, blisters, redness, swelling, or ingrown nails.

2. FOOTWEAR RULES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Shake:** Shake out shoes before putting them on (a pebble could cause a wound you can't feel).
* **Socks:** Wear white (to see blood/drainage) and seamless (to prevent rubbing) socks.
* **No Barefoot:** Never walk barefoot, even indoors.

3. HYGIENE
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Wash feet daily in lukewarm water (test temp with elbow, not foot).
* Dry thoroughly *between* the toes (moisture leads to fungal infection).
* Apply lotion to tops and bottoms, but **never** between toes.

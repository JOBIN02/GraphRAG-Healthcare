SUBJECT: Protocol for Reversing Prediabetes
SOURCE: National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP)
GOAL: Return HbA1c to <5.7% via Lifestyle Intervention

1. THE CORE OBJECTIVE: 5-7% WEIGHT LOSS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The National DPP study proved that lifestyle changes are *more* effective than 
medication (metformin) for preventing diabetes in the long run.

* **The Magic Number:** Losing just 5% to 7% of your starting body weight.
* **The Math:**
    -   If you weigh 200 lbs (90 kg) -> Loss Goal: 10 to 14 lbs (4.5 - 6 kg).
    -   If you weigh 250 lbs (113 kg) -> Loss Goal: 12 to 18 lbs (5.5 - 8 kg).
* **Why it Works:** This specific amount of weight loss preferentially targets 
    visceral fat (liver/pancreas fat), which drastically reduces insulin 
    resistance.

2. NUTRITIONAL STRATEGY: THE PLATE METHOD
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You do not need to cut out carbs entirely, but you must change the proportion. 
Visualize your dinner plate as a pie chart.

A. 50% Non-Starchy Vegetables (The Base)
   * *Examples:* Spinach, broccoli, peppers, cauliflower, green beans.
   * *Mechanism:* High fiber slows gastric emptying, preventing blood sugar 
       spikes.

B. 25% Lean Protein (The Satiety Factor)
   * *Examples:* Chicken, turkey, fish, tofu, beans, eggs.
   * *Mechanism:* Protein does not raise blood glucose and keeps you full 
       longer, reducing snacking urges.

C. 25% Carbohydrate Foods (The Fuel)
   * *Examples:* Brown rice, oats, quinoa, sweet potato, whole grain bread.
   * *The Shift:* Switch from "White" (refined) to "Brown" (complex). Complex 
       carbs take longer to break down into glucose.

D. Water (The Beverage)
   * Eliminate "Liquid Sugar" (soda, juice, sweet tea). This is the single 
       fastest way to lower A1C.

3. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROTOCOL
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Target:** 150 minutes per week (e.g., 30 mins x 5 days).
* **Intensity:** Moderate (Can talk, but can't sing).
* **The Mechanism (Why it reverses Prediabetes):**
    -   Normally, insulin opens the door for sugar to enter muscle cells.
    -   During exercise, muscle contractions activate **AMPK**, which moves 
        glucose transporters (GLUT4) to the surface *without* needing insulin.
    -   *Result:* You lower blood sugar even if you are insulin resistant.

4. BEHAVIORAL TACTICS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Tracking (Self-Monitoring)
   * Keep a food log (app or paper). People who track what they eat lose 
       twice as much weight as those who don't.

B. Sleep Hygiene
   * **Goal:** 7-8 hours per night.
   * **Mechanism:** Sleep deprivation increases **Ghrelin** (hunger hormone) 
       and cortisol, driving cravings for high-sugar foods.

C. Stress Management
   * Chronic stress keeps Cortisol levels high. Cortisol signals the liver 
       to dump glucose into the blood (fighting the "fight or flight" response).
   * *Action:* Deep breathing or meditation lowers cortisol and blood sugar.

5. WHEN TO RETEST
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Schedule a follow-up A1C test in **3 to 6 months**.
* It takes ~3 months for red blood cells to turnover, so testing sooner 
    won't show the full picture.

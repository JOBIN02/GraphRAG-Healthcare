SUBJECT: Self-Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG)
METHOD: Capillary Blood Glucose Test (Finger Stick)

1. HOW THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS (THE STRIP MECHANISM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The test strip is not just a piece of plastic; it is a mini-electrochemical 
cell.

A. The Enzyme Layer
   * The tip of the strip contains an enzyme, typically **Glucose Oxidase** or **Glucose Dehydrogenase**.
   * When blood hits the strip, the enzyme reacts with the glucose in the 
     blood to produce Gluconic Acid.

B. The Electrical Current (Amperometry)
   * This chemical reaction releases electrons.
   * The meter applies a small voltage to the strip.
   * The moving electrons create an electrical current.
   * **The Calculation:** The strength of the current is directly proportional 
     to the amount of glucose in the sample. The meter calculates this and 
     displays the number.

2. PREPARATION (CRITICAL FOR ACCURACY)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Wash and Dry Hands
   * **Must do:** Use warm water and soap.
   * **Why:** Sugar residue on fingers (from fruit, lotion, or dirt) will 
     mix with the blood drop and cause a falsely high reading. 
   * **Dry Thoroughly:** Water dilutes the blood sample, causing a falsely 
     low reading.

B. Prepare the Lancet Device
   * Insert a new, sterile lancet (needle) into the lancing device.
   * **Depth Setting:** Adjust the depth gauge.
     - Thin skin/children: 1-2
     - Average skin: 3-4
     - Calloused/thick skin: 5

3. THE PROCEDURE (STEP-BY-STEP)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Load the Strip:** Insert the test strip into the meter. Wait for the 
   "drop" icon to appear.

2. **Select the Site:** * Do NOT prick the fleshy pad (center) of the fingertip. It has the most 
     nerve endings and hurts the most.
   * **Target:** The sides of the fingertip (lateral aspect).

3. **Stimulate Flow:** Massage the finger from the palm toward the tip to 
   encourage blood flow.

4. **Lance:** Place the device firmly against the side of the finger and 
   press the button.

5. **The Drop:** Squeeze gently to get a round drop of blood. 
   * *Pro-Tip:* Wipe away the very first drop with a tissue (it may contain 
     interstitial fluid) and use the second drop for the most accuracy (though 
     modern meters often accept the first drop).

6. **Application:** Touch the *tip* of the strip to the blood drop. Do not 
   drip blood *on top* of the strip; let the strip sip it up via capillary action.

7. **Clean Up:** Apply pressure to the finger with a tissue. Dispose of the 
   lancet in a sharps container.

4. INTERPRETING THE DATA (ADA TARGETS)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Target ranges vary by individual, but standard goals for non-pregnant adults are:

| Timing              | Target Range (mg/dL) | Target Range (mmol/L) |
|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Fasting (Pre-meal)  | 80 – 130 mg/dL       | 4.4 – 7.2 mmol/L      |
| Postprandial (2hrs) | Less than 180 mg/dL  | Less than 10.0 mmol/L |

5. COMMON ERROR CODES & CAUSES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Not enough blood:** The strip didn't fill completely.
* **Expired strips:** Enzymes degrade over time and with humidity.
* **Temperature:** Meter is too hot or too cold (must be at room temp).
* **Contamination:** "Sugar fingers" (unwashed hands).

6. ALTERNATIVE: CONTINUOUS GLUCOSE MONITORING (CGM)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **How it works:** A tiny filament sits under the skin (usually arm or belly) 
  measuring glucose in the *interstitial fluid* (fluid between cells), not 
  the blood.
* **Lag Time:** Interstitial glucose lags behind blood glucose by ~10-15 
  minutes. Finger sticks are still required to verify sudden highs or lows.

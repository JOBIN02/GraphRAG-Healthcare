SUBJECT: Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus - Basics, Risk, and Diagnosis

1. WHAT IS TYPE 2 DIABETES?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects how the body processes 
blood sugar (glucose). 

* **Insulin Resistance:** The body does not use insulin properly. The 
    pancreas tries to make extra insulin to compensate, but eventually, it 
    cannot keep up, and blood sugar levels rise.
* **Prevalence:** It accounts for approximately 90-95% of all diagnosed 
    cases of diabetes.

2. RISK FACTORS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
You are at higher risk for developing Type 2 diabetes if you:

* **Have Prediabetes:** Blood sugar is higher than normal but not yet high 
    enough to be diagnosed as diabetes.
* **Are Overweight:** Being overweight or having obesity is a primary risk.
* **Age:** Are age 45 or older.
* **Family History:** Have a parent, brother, or sister with type 2 diabetes.
* **Activity Level:** Are physically active less than 3 times a week.
* **Gestational History:** Have ever had gestational diabetes (during 
    pregnancy) or gave birth to a baby who weighed over 9 pounds.
* **Ethnicity:** Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, 
    or Alaska Native. (Some Pacific Islanders and Asian Americans are also 
    at higher risk).

3. SYMPTOMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Symptoms often develop slowly over several years. Many people have no 
symptoms until health problems occur.

* Frequent urination (often at night).
* Excessive thirst.
* Unexplained weight loss.
* Very hungry.
* Blurry vision.
* Numbness or tingling in hands or feet.
* Feeling very tired (fatigue).
* Very dry skin.
* Sores that heal slowly.
* More infections than usual.

4. DIAGNOSIS (A1C TEST)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The A1C test measures your average blood sugar level over the past 2 to 3 
months.

| Diagnosis    | A1C Level        |
|--------------|------------------|
| Normal       | Below 5.7%       |
| Prediabetes  | 5.7% – 6.4%      |
| Diabetes     | 6.5% or higher   |

*Note: Fasting Plasma Glucose (FPG) and Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests (OGTT) 
are also used for diagnosis.*

5. PREVENTION & MANAGEMENT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Type 2 diabetes can often be prevented or delayed with lifestyle changes.

A. Healthy Eating
   - Focus on non-starchy vegetables (leafy greens, peppers, broccoli).
   - Choose whole grains over refined grains.
   - Limit added sugars and refined carbohydrates.

B. Physical Activity
   - Goal: At least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity (like brisk 
     walking) per week.
   - Strength training 2 days a week is also recommended.

C. Weight Loss
   - Losing a modest amount of weight (5% to 7% of total body weight) can 
     significantly lower the risk. 
     *Example: For a 200 lb person, this is a loss of 10-14 lbs.*

6. COMPLICATIONS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncontrolled high blood sugar can lead to:
* Heart disease and stroke.
* Kidney disease (Chronic Kidney Disease).
* Eye problems (Retinopathy, Cataracts, Glaucoma).
* Nerve damage (Neuropathy).
* Foot health issues (can lead to amputation if untreated).
* Gum disease and dental problems.

ABSTRACT
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKGROUND: 
Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) represents a clustering of cardiovascular risk 
factors that includes central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and 
hyperglycemia. Its prevalence is rising globally, paralleling the obesity 
epidemic. This review aims to define the clinical criteria and quantify the 
excess risk for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) and Type 2 Diabetes (T2DM).

METHODS: 
A systematic review of epidemiological data from the NHANES and WHO databases 
was performed. We analyzed studies linking insulin resistance to the 
development of atherosclerotic plaques and endothelial dysfunction.

RESULTS: 
Metabolic Syndrome is generally defined by the presence of three or more of 
the following five criteria: (1) Waist circumference >102cm (men) or >88cm 
(women); (2) Triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL; (3) HDL cholesterol <40 mg/dL (men) 
or <50 mg/dL (women); (4) Blood pressure ≥130/85 mmHg; (5) Fasting glucose 
≥100 mg/dL. Individuals with MetS have a 2-fold increase in the risk of CVD 
and a 5-fold increase in the risk of developing T2DM compared to those 
without the syndrome. The central driver appears to be insulin resistance, 
which triggers an inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state.

CONCLUSION: 
MetS is a critical public health warning sign. Identifying patients with 
this cluster of risk factors allows for early lifestyle intervention. 
Weight loss of 5-10% remains the primary therapeutic intervention to 
reverse the underlying insulin resistance and mitigate cardiovascular risk.

SUBJECT: Diabetic Retinopathy (Eye Disease)
TYPE: Microvascular Complication
SEVERITY: Leading cause of blindness in working-age adults (20-74).

1. OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diabetic Retinopathy damages the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue 
at the back of the eye (retina). It is a progressive condition directly linked 
to the duration of diabetes and the severity of hyperglycemia.

2. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY (THE MECHANISM OF LEAKAGE)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The retina has the highest metabolic rate (oxygen consumption) of any tissue 
in the body. It relies on a delicate network of capillaries.

A. Pericyte Loss (The First Domino)
   * Capillaries are supported by cells called "pericytes" that wrap around 
     them like a structural wall.
   * High blood sugar triggers apoptosis (cell death) of these pericytes.
   * **Result:** The vessel walls weaken and balloon out, forming 
     **Microaneurysms**.

B. Ischemia and Hypoxia
   * Capillaries eventually become blocked by thickened basement membranes.
   * The retina becomes "hypoxic" (starved of oxygen).
   * **Cotton Wool Spots:** White, fluffy patches appear on the retina, 
     signaling areas of nerve fiber infarction (death due to lack of blood).

C. The VEGF Response (The Fatal Flaw)
   * The oxygen-starved retina sends out a distress signal: **Vascular 
     Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF)**.
   * VEGF commands the eye to grow *new* blood vessels to supply oxygen.
   * **The Problem:** These new vessels (Neovascularization) are fragile, 
     abnormal, and leaky. They rupture easily, bleeding into the eye.

3. STAGES OF PROGRESSION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)
   * **"Background Retinopathy"**
   * Blood vessels are damaged but new ones haven't started growing yet.
   * Vessels leak fluid and lipids into the retina.
   * **Hard Exudates:** Yellow deposits of lipid/protein leaked from vessels.
   * Vision is usually fine unless fluid accumulates in the macula.

B. Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)
   * **"Advanced Retinopathy"**
   * VEGF has triggered the growth of fragile new blood vessels on the surface 
     of the retina and into the vitreous gel.
   * **Risks:** 1. Vitreous Hemorrhage (bleeding into the jelly of the eye).
     2. Tractional Retinal Detachment (scar tissue pulls the retina off the 
        back of the eye).

4. SPECIFIC COMPLICATION: DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA (DME)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Can occur at *any* stage (NPDR or PDR).
* Fluid builds up in the **Macula** (the center part of the retina responsible 
  for sharp, straight-ahead vision).
* **Symptom:** Objects look wavy or blurry; colors look washed out.

5. SYMPTOMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Early stages are often asymptomatic (silent). As it advances:
* "Floaters" (dark strings floating in vision - usually blood).
* Blurred or fluctuating vision.
* Dark or empty areas in your vision.
* Difficulty seeing at night.

6. TREATMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **Anti-VEGF Injections:** Drugs (like ranibizumab or aflibercept) are 
  injected directly into the eye to block the VEGF signal, stopping abnormal 
  vessel growth.
* **Photocoagulation (Laser Surgery):**
  - *Focal Laser:* Seals specific leaking vessels.
  - *Scatter Laser (Panretinal):* Shrinks abnormal blood vessels by making 
    tiny burns across the peripheral retina.
* **Vitrectomy:** Surgical removal of blood-filled vitreous gel.

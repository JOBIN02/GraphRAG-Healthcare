SUBJECT: GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (Incretin Mimetics)
CLASS: Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Agonists
COMMON BRANDS: Ozempic, Wegovy, Trulicity, Victoza, Mounjaro (Dual agonist)

1. OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
GLP-1 Receptor Agonists are a class of non-insulin injectable medications 
(though an oral version exists). They mimic the action of the natural hormone 
GLP-1, which is released from the gut in response to eating.

* **Key Characteristic:** Their action is "Glucose-Dependent." They only 
  stimulate insulin when blood sugar is high, making the risk of dangerous 
  hypoglycemia very low compared to insulin or sulfonylureas.

2. MECHANISM OF ACTION (THE MULTI-ORGAN EFFECT)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These drugs do not just lower sugar; they alter how the body manages energy 
intake and processing across four key organs.

A. The Pancreas (The Dual Switch)
   * **Insulin:** Stimulates beta-cells to release insulin *only* when glucose 
     levels are elevated.
   * **Glucagon:** Suppresses the release of glucagon (the hormone that raises 
     blood sugar) from alpha-cells.

B. The Stomach (The "Brake")
   * **Delayed Gastric Emptying:** Slows down the speed at which food leaves 
     the stomach.
   * **Result:** This flattens the post-meal blood sugar spike and physically 
     signals fullness to the brain.

C. The Brain (The Appetite Control Center)
   * GLP-1 receptors are present in the hypothalamus (hunger center).
   * **Satiety:** These drugs directly stimulate the feeling of "fullness."
   * **Cravings:** They reduce the "food noise" (intrusive thoughts about 
     food) and reward-seeking behavior associated with eating.

D. The Liver
   * Because glucagon is suppressed, the liver reduces its output of stored 
     glucose (Gluconeogenesis).

3. CLASSIFICATION AND EVOLUTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The class has evolved from twice-daily injections to weekly injections with 
higher potency.

| Generation | Generic Name | Brand Examples | Frequency | Primary Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **First** | Exenatide | Byetta | Twice Daily | Diabetes Control |
| **Second** | Liraglutide | Victoza / Saxenda | Daily | Diabetes & Weight |
| **Third** | Dulaglutide | Trulicity | Weekly | Diabetes Control |
| **Fourth** | Semaglutide | Ozempic / Wegovy | Weekly | High Potency Weight & Diabetes |
| **Next Gen**| Tirzepatide*| Mounjaro / Zepbound | Weekly | *Dual Agonist (GLP-1 + GIP) |

* *Note: Tirzepatide is technically a dual agonist, activating both GLP-1 and 
  GIP receptors, leading to even greater efficacy.*

4. CLINICAL BENEFITS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* **A1C Reduction:** Highly effective, typically lowering A1C by 1.0% to 2.0%.
* **Weight Loss:**
  - Semaglutide: ~15% body weight loss in clinical trials.
  - Tirzepatide: Up to ~20%+ body weight loss.
* **Cardiovascular Protection:** Many agents in this class (Semaglutide, 
  Liraglutide) have FDA indications for reducing the risk of heart attack 
  and stroke in people with heart disease.

5. SIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Gastrointestinal (The Most Common)
   * Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea affect a significant portion of users.
   * **Mechanism:** Caused by the slowing of the stomach (gastroparesis effect).
   * **Management:** Usually transient. Mitigated by starting at a low dose 
     and "titrating" (increasing) slowly over months.

B. Rare / Serious Warnings
   * **Pancreatitis:** Risk of inflammation of the pancreas.
   * **Gallbladder Disease:** Rapid weight loss can lead to gallstones.
   * **Thyroid C-Cell Tumors:** Black Box Warning based on rodent studies 
     (risk in humans is not confirmed but contraindicated in those with a 
     family history of MTC).
